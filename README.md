# XGB_Classifier
 
## 95 % Promotion Accuracy. (Promotion Prediction Robot for Companies).

It is not at all appropriate to create a machine learning model that predicts outcomes, especially if it has an immediate impact on people's wellbeing.

There is no programming for emotions. That is something that none of the bots have. However, prior to deployment, bots are frequently taught, tested, retrained, and retested until they meet our expectations; however, humans must still interfere at some point.

This bot is like Logistic Regression bot in that it uses the Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier (xgb classifier) to predict whether or not workers will be promoted based on their performance and other criteria.

It’s a more sophisticated variant of Logistic Regression.

Kindly check the Github for the Bot that’s able to have 95% prediction accuracy.
